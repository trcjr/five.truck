Back in June 2016, while living in South Florida, I came across a Craigslist ad for a 1964 VW Beetle. I messaged the seller on the morning of June 8th, and just a few days later — on June 11th — we hit the road for Waycross, Tennessee to bring it home. The car cost $4,200.

That road trip became unforgettable — not just because of the car. At a gas station on the way home, my wife tripped and fell face-first. Thankfully, she made a full recovery, and it’s now a moment we both laugh about when we look back on that adventure.

Since then, the Beetle has undergone some thoughtful upgrades, including:
- A 4" narrowed, adjustable front beam from Airkewld
- A front disc brake conversion

It’s been the start of a long-term restomod project — equal parts mechanical, personal, and nostalgic.
